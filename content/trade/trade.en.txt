In the African Terminal, new locals from Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria and cultural workers have come together to jointly organize sea-trade between Hamburg and West Africa. Here, people act together and trade goods in order to build bridges between communities, in Hamburg and over sea. Like this, we all win: You get rid of your used household items, new Hamburg citizens gain expertise in the export business, and we all learn more about how the harbor connects us to the world. 

The African Terminal connects Hamburg and Lagos (Nigeria), Tema (Ghana), and Banjul (Gambia), the countries of origin of most of our members. Thereby, the African Terminal uses the expertise of people who have recently arrived in Hamburg. In the African Terminal, it's the people who trade and act together, not big corporations or established businesses. 

**To get started, the African Terminal collects used household items and electrical appliances all over Hamburg to ship them to West Africa. Donate your fridge or TV set and become a contributor of the African Terminal!**
