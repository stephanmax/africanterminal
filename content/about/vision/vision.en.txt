Today, the big warehouse of the old Africa Terminal is vacant. If the city of Hamburg temporarily granted us access to the terminal, we could try to turn the place into a truly African Terminal. As part of a larger cooperation with other cultural institutions or collectives that can animate the place as a cultural hub, this is what we aim for in the midterm. geheimagentur has issued a potential analysis for the Baakenhöft that can be obtained [on demand](mailto:info@geheimagentur.net).

**The African Terminal is in its test phase. During our first transaction, from August 17 to 24, we will fill one container with things, and a second one with conversations, ideas and plans for the future of the African Terminal. Come to the FREE PORT BAAKENHÖFT and think and make plans with us!**
